107. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II

Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. 
(ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), 
design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Example 1:

Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5

max. difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price)



Example 2:

Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0

In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
