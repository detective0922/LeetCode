107. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST. 

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: ��The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).��

   0      _4       7       9
         /  \
         3   5


For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. 
Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
